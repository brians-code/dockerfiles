This set of Docker files build a PHP dev stack based on Cloud9. The images are stored on my [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/briansdocker/). 

The easiest way to use these images is to checkout my [Cloud9 repo](https://github.com/briansrepo/cloud9). You will also find a complete explanation of how to use it, and why I built it the way I did.
